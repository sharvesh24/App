# App Review Analysis


The project focuses on the analysis of app reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It begins by collecting data from the Google Play Store, specifically for the Microsoft App Manager. The reviews are preprocessed to clean the text, removing special characters, punctuation, and stop words, while also performing lemmatization.

Language detection ensures that only English reviews are retained. The project then ranks the reviews based on the frequency of specific keywords, helping to highlight user sentiments and opinions. The processed data is saved into a CSV file for further analysis. 

Ultimately, this project aims to provide insights into user feedback to improve app features and user satisfaction.
